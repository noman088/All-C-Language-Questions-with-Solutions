1. Define a function to input variable length string and store it in an array without
memory wastage.

2. Write a program to ask the user to input a number of data values he would like to

and free.

5. Write a program to read a one dimensional array, print sum of all elements along with
inputted array elements using dynamic memory allocation.

6. Write a program in C to find the largest element using Dynamic Memory Allocation.

7. Write a program to demonaate memory leak in C.

8. Write a program to demonaate dangling pointers in C.

9. Write a program to allocate memory dynamically of the size in bytes entered by the
user. Also handle the case when memory allocation is failed.
